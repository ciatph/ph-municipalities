## ph-municipalities

The **ph-municipalities** NPM package provides **NPM scripts** that allow interactive querying of Philippine municipalities included in one or more provinces or from a whole region, with an option of writing them to JSON files from the command line through a CLI-like application and **classes** for only parsing and listing municipality names and provinces from Excel file data sources.

It uses a **PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel** file in `/app/data/day1.xlsx` (downloaded and stored as of this 20220808) from PAGASA's [10-Day Climate Forecast web page](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast) as the default data source.

> Since the **PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel** files do not have region names, the parser scripts sync it with the **PAGASA Seasonal weather forecast** regions and province names defined in the manually-encoded `/app/config/regions.json` file to determine the region names. The **classes** also provide an option to specify a new region name configuration file on initialization.

It also asks users to key in the file download URL of a remote PAGASA 10-Day weather forecast Excel file should they want to use another Excel file for a new and updated data source.

> _**INFO:** When installing the package using `npm i ph-municipalities`, the default data source is insideÂ `/data/day1.xlsx`. All source codes and files are also inside the **ph-municipalities** root directory._

## FAQs

<details>
<summary style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
<b>What is the purpose or goal of ph-municipalities?</b>
</summary>

<br>

ph-municipalities aims to provide a simple, organized, and flexible interface for viewing, querying, and listing Philippine provinces and municipalities using the [PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel files](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast) as the data source. It aims to enable easy extension of Philippine regions/provinces/municipalities listing for parsing the PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data.

Its early stages were written as procedural functions within a _private backend project_ for extracting 10-day weather forecast data from the PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel files. When the private project started gaining complexity, a need to separate the logic and management for listing the Philippine province and municipalities per region rose. Creating an independent, public OpenSource version listing the provinces and municipalities per region was decided after experiencing drawbacks and difficulties testing using similar OpenSource libraries (some of which are [listed below](#similar-libraries)) for that project.

> **_ph-municipalities aim to contribute to the OpenSource community by listing ONLY Philippine provinces and municipalities' names, using [PAGASA's 10-day weather forecast Excel files](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast), which are publicly accessible to everyone._**

**ph-municipalities** is entirely public and open-source, and it has no linkage to private and proprietary source codes and resources.

<summary style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
<b>Can ph-municipalities parse and extract PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data?</b>
</summary>

<br>

While ph-municipalities use a [PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel file](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast) as a data source for its provinces and municipalities list, **_NO, it cannot parse and extract PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data_**.

ph-municipalities only have class methods for parsing, extracting, listing and querying provinces and municipalities names data from a PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel file. Refer to the **ExcelFile** [class documentation](https://ciatph.github.io/ph-municipalities/ExcelFile.html) for more information about its available methods.

<summary style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;" id="similar-libraries">
<b>Are there alternative libraries to ph-municipalities for listing Philippine provinces and municipalities?</b>
</summary>

<br>

Yes, several OpenSource libraries and projects similar to ph-municipalities exist, which you can use in its place to list Philippine provinces and municipalities.

Here is a list of several of these libraries and code repositories.
Note, however, that these items use old and new data sources. These may not be for you if you require using provinces and municipalities' names data from the [PAGASA 10-day weather forecast Excel files](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast).

<b>Is it possible to make ph-municipalities parse and extract PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data?</b>
</summary>

<br>

While ph-municipalites do not support parsing and extracting PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data, _you can extend the `ExcelFile` or `ExcelFactory` classes with custom logic and codes to enable parsing and extracting PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data_.

Since the `ExcelFile` or `ExcelFactory` are JavaScript [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) (Functions in disguise, not true OOP, but inheritance still works), you can extend them with class inheritance, overriding or creating new class methods to accommodate processing the PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data. Refer to the [ph-municipalities class documentation](https://ciatph.github.io/ph-municipalities) to know more about the available classes, member variables, and methods.

An example of extending the classes to parse PAGASA 10-day weather forecast data may go along the lines of:

```javascript
const { ExcelFile } = require('ph-municipalities')

class PAGASATendayParser extends ExcelFile {
  /* Override constructor if neccessary
  constructor (params) {
    super(params)

    // Custom class initialization logic here
  }
  */

  getWeatherData () {
    // Note: this.#data contains the "raw" original Excel rows data as JSON with weather data

    const weatherData = this.#data.reduce((list, row, index) => {
      // Write logic to parse and extract weather data here
    }, [])

    return weatherData
  }
}

const parser = new PAGASATendayParser()
weatherForecast = parser.getWeatherData()

```

<summary style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
  <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
    <b>How does ph-municipalities determine which provinces belong to a region?</b>
  </span>
</summary>

<br>

The PAGASA 10-day Excel files only contain province and municipality names linked with weather data - _it has no region information_. Therefore, ph-municipalities link the province names in the 10-day Excel files to region/province names defined in the `/app/config/regions.json` file to determine which region they belong to.

### The `/app/config/regions.json` file

This file contains region/province names mapping encoded manually with reference from the region and province names listed in the [PAGASA Seasonal Forecast website's](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/seasonal-forecast) Forecast Analysis Rainfall table.


**ph-municipalities** expect similar region naming conventions from the **PAGASA Seasonal Forecast** and the **PAGASA 10-Day Forecast** since both are data products produced by PAGASA.


> **NOTE:**<br>
> The region/province mapping defined in this file may become outdated as time passes. ph-municipalities users are encouraged to [Use a Custom Configuration File](#using-a-custom-configuration-file), defining new region/province name mappings following the file's current format if they notice region-to-province inconsistencies in the generated municipality lists.

<details>
<summary style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
  <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 22px;">
    <b>Are the provinces and municipality lists generated by ph-municipalities updated?</b>
  </span>
</summary>

<br>

NO. By default, ph-municipalities use an outdated PAGASA 10-day Excel file for its local data source, downloaded on August 8, 2022. However, it also provides several ways for using updated PAGASA 10-day Excel files as data sources:

- Prompting to download an updated PAGASA 10-day Excel file using the [Interactive CLI Scripts](#interactive-cli-scripts)
- Providing [class methods](https://ciatph.github.io/ph-municipalities/ExcelFile.html#download) for programmatically downloading and using a remote PAGASA 10-day Excel file
- Allowing to override the default region - province mapping settings during class initialization (See [Class Usage - Using a Custom Configuration File](#using-a-custom-configuration-file))

> **NOTE:**<br>
> Overall, the provinces and municipality list rely on the latest contents of a [PAGASA 10-day Excel file](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-prediction/10-day-climate-forecast) and manual configuration of region/province names mapping in the `/app/config/regions.json` file (See [Class Usage - Using a Custom Configuration File](#using-a-custom-configuration-file)). It is not yet known and tested if these are in sync with the latest regions, provinces, and municipalities in the more standard and canon [Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc) data.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config()
const path = require('path')
const ExcelFile = require('../classes/excel')

// Use the the following if installed via npm
// const { ExcelFile } = require('ph-municipalities')

const main = async () => {
  // Excel file will be downloaded to /app/src/examples/excelfile.xlsx

<span id="using-a-custom-configuration-file"></span>
### Using a Custom Configuration File

The **ph-municipalities**Â `ExcelFile` and `ExcelFactory` classes use a default configuration file to define their regions and provinces in theÂ `/app/config/regions.json`Â file. The data in this file syncs with the PAGASA Seasonal and 10-Day Weather Forecast Excel files provinces and municipalities naming convention, encoded by hand as of August 24, 2024.

Follow the codes to define a custom regions config file, following the format of theÂ `/app/config/regions.json`Â file to customize region definitions.

> _**Note:**Â The custom config file's province/municipality names should match those in the 10-day Excel file._

#### Availability

This method is available from ph-municipalities version [1.3.3](https://github.com/ciatph/ph-municipalities/releases/tag/v1.3.3) and higher.

<span id="building-the-class-documentation"></span>
## Building the Class Documentation

The class documentation uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) annotations where applicable in the JavaScript source codes inside the **/src** directory. There are two (2) options for building the class documentation.

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 18px;" id="using-docker">
  <b>Using Docker</b>
</summary>

1. Run docker for localhost development. Refer to the [Docker for Localhost Development](#docker-for-localhost-development) section for more information.

2. Install the dependencies for JSDoc. Suceeding builds will not need to install dependencies after an initial installation. Refer to the [**npm run docs:install**](#npm-run-docsinstall) script usage for more information.<br>
   ```bash
   docker exec -u root -it ph-municipalities npm run docs:install
   ```

3. Build the documentation. Refer to the [**npm run docs:build**](#npm-run-docsbuild) script usage for more information.<br>
   ```bash
   docker exec -u root -it ph-municipalities npm run docs:build
   ```

  <b>Using NodeJS</b>
</summary>

1. Install the dependencies for JSDoc. Refer to the [**`npm run generate-docs`**](#npm-run-generate-docs) Script usage for more information.
2. Copy Bash scripts to the **/app** directory.
   - Create a **/scripts** directory inside the **/app** directory.
   - Copy the `/scripts/docs-install.sh` and `/scripts/docs-build.sh` Bash scripts to the **/scripts** directory created from the previous step.
3. Copy static assets to the **/app** directory.
   - Copy the `/docs/diagrams` directory inside the **/app** directory.
   - Copy the `README.md` file to the **/app** directory.
4. Add appropriate user permission to the files.
   ```bash
   chmod u+x scripts/docs-install.sh
   chmod u+x scripts/docs-build.sh
   ```
5. Run the commands for building the documentation.

   > **INFO:** Use a GitBash terminal if you are working on a Windows OS machine.

   ```bash
   ./scripts/docs-install.sh
   ./scripts/docs-build.sh
   ```

<span id="troubleshooting"></span>
## Troubleshooting

This section describes several common errors and related fixes.

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 18px;">
  <b>EACCESS: permission denied</b>
</summary>

#### Information

- This error usually happens when writing to files inside Docker-mounted volumes on an Ubuntu host during run time.
- A full sample error log is:<br>
   > EACCESS: permission denied, open '/opt/app/region1.json'

#### Fix

1. Find the host UID of the ph-municipalities Docker user. Its name is `"app,"` defined in the Dockerfile.<br>
   `docker run --rm -it ciatph/ph-municipalities:dev sh -c "id -u app"`
2. Change the ownership of the `./app` directory using the ph-municipalities user host UID from **step #1**.<br>
   `sudo chown -R <APP_UID>:<APP_UID> ./app`
3. Re-run the NPM script.
